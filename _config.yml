# Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>like this</mark>.
  I'm a very passionate and curious person, always looking for the next challenge to dive in and accomplish.

  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#what-is-markdown) supports such as
    - Lists
    - Tables
    - <a href="google.com">Links</a>

          Short overview of the project 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Final course project in Orbital Mechanics. The topics to be developed were: an Interplanetary Mission from Mercury to Neptune with power gravity assist on Mars, 
          developed both with classical numerical minimisation approaches and with genetic algorithm methods.
          Furthermore a second part was related to the development of an Earth's orbit environment mission, on which the objective was to propagate the spacecraft dynamics with
          both Gauss and Lagrange methods, taking into account J2 effect and 3rd body Moon effect, compare them, assess the ground track coverage and perform a comparison with real 
          satellite telemetry data.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
